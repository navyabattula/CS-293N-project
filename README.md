# CS-293N-project

Usage : run data.ipynb with necessary files from input data folder. Additional input files not provided here due to size constarints. Check out https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12fYM8DL49YsiLWk7t_iDYvNt99hcKVvi?usp=sharing for getting access to pickled datasets and flow wise input files.

Folder CICflowmeter consists of the implementation of CICflowmeter tool along with the batch file. 

The notebook files pcap_split is called to split pcap file into flow wise pcap files and the notebook file timeseries extraction for extracting flow wise timeseries data from these flow wise pcap files.


Simplified usage: Skip pre - processing, download the pickled files in https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12fYM8DL49YsiLWk7t_iDYvNt99hcKVvi?usp=sharing and use them in model.ipynb to train the model
